# Contributing

## Project setup

- make sure node and npm are installed
- run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- warning: in case of issues, first delete package-lock and node_modules and try rerunning install ([This is why we recommend this](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1071#issuecomment-343726601))

## Hacking

- run `yarn test` to execute tests
- you can use `yarn run test-watch` to automatically rerun tests while you edit the code
- run `yarn lint` to check your code against the rules. Please make sure it passes before contributing
